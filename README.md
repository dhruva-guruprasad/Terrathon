# Terrathon

**PROBLEM STATEMENT**
"To develop efficient methods to minimize energy consumption of minting & validating NFTs using a Blockchain" 

NFTs ballooned to a $41 Billion market in 2021, but there some serious underlying environmental issues underscoring the use of NFTs in particular. For instance, SuperRare is an NFT Marketplace with 18,159 NFTs listed. The total energy consumed to mint, transact and validate these NFTs is a staggering 6 Million kWh -  equivalent to emissions caused by driving a car for 20 Million Kilometres. This marketplace alone will result in 3.8 Tonnes of Carbon Dioxide emissions -  a clarion call for more environmentally sustainable ways of transacting using NFTs. This closely resonates with the theme of "Responsible Consumption & Production". Innovations in this space will help usher in the next revolution of sustainable and environmentally friendly blockchain technologies. 

**PROPOSED SOLUTION**
Minimizing carbon footprint of NFTs is an exciting area of research - and is our central ambition for the Hackathon. We would attempt to develop an alternative method of minting NFTs by stuffing in more data within each block, ensuring that significantly lesser ''average" energy is consumed by each minted NFT. We would also attempt to research & implement a basic version of 'Proof of History' to make validation quicker and more scalable. We also aspire to create a NFT marketplace that implements possible algorithms discussed above. Therefore we would be able to create a more scalable & environmentally sustainable solution to a pressing problem.
